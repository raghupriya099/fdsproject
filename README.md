Analysis and Prediction of Diabetes Mellitus using Machine Learning Algorithm

Objectives
Risk prediction of diabetes using Machine learning techniques.
Accuracy and ROC metrics used to find best possible machine learning technique.

Dataset
The dataset is taken from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Early+stage+diabetes+risk+prediction+dataset.
Dataset contains the sign and symptom data of newly diabetic or would be diabetic. Dataset has 520 instances and 17 attributes.

Methadology
Firstly, data is pre-processed for the given dataset. Pre-processing means to fill the missing values, remove duplication and data conversion. Next, apply machine learning algorithms to training set (data after being pre-processes) for prediction. Algorithms used for prediction are Logistic regression, Random forest, and decision trees. 
Prediction algorithms
1.	Logistic Regression- Logistic Regression is machine learning   algorithm used when dependent variable is categorical. The output for logistic regression is based on opportunity feature. 
2.	Decision Trees- Decision tree is a tree shaped diagram that is used for determining a course of action. Each branch of the tree represents a possible decision
3.	Random Forest- Random forest is a versatile, easy-to-use machine learning algorithm that, in most cases, produces excellent results even without hyper-parameter tuning. 
For all algorithms, confusion matrix plot and classification report are done. Classification report consists of finding precision, recall and f1-score.
